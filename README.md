# Precious Metals Price ðŸª™

## Introduction
**Precious Metals Price** is a financial data analysis showcase using Jupyter Notebook, focusing on the most popular precious metals. The recent surge in their prices has sparked curiosity, making this a compelling topic to study. This project aims to analyze and forecast gold and silver prices, incorporating several related datasets. For detailed information about the datasets source, check it [here](/data/README.md).


## Tools Used
- **YFinance**: To gather some of the financial data using the Yahoo Finance API.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The interactive environment used for coding and data analysis.
- **Pandas**: For cleaning, standardizing, manipulating, and analyzing datasets.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For creating charts.
- **NumPy and SciPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Statsmodels**: For time series decomposition and statistical modeling.
- **Scikit-learn**: For model evaluation metrics.
- **Pmdarima**: For automated ARIMA modeling.


## Analysis Overview
This project delves into several aspects of the most traded precious metals prices using a range of Python libraries, primarily Pandas, to offer comprehensive insights. It includes an in-depth examination of historical gold and silver prices, a brief analysis of the US consumer price index (CPI), and an exploration of correlations between these commodities and other related datasets. Furthermore, it provides a comparative analysis of gold and silver and forecasts their prices using two distinct methods.

![Gold Monte Carlo 1Y hist chart](/images/6.1_AU_Monte_Carlo_1Y_hist.png)
*Histogram chart of gold price distribution for mid-May 2025 from Monte Carlo simulation.*

**Key takeaways:**
- The probability of gold exceeding its all-time high by mid-May of 2025 is about 64%.
- The likelihood of surpassing \$3,000 by mid-May of 2025 is approximately 22%.
- The chance of falling below \$2,000 by mid-May of 2025 is nearly 10%.

#### Ten years forecast

*Histogram chart of gold price distribution for mid-May 2034 from Monte Carlo simulation.*

**Key takeaways:**
- The probability of gold exceeding its all-time high by mid-May of 2034 is about 89%.
- The likelihood of surpassing \$5,000 by mid-May of 2034 is approximately 51%.
- The chance of falling below \$2,000 by mid-May of 2034 is nearly 7%.

### Deterministic forecasting of the silver price using SARIMA method ðŸ”® <a name = "AG_SARIMA"></a>
![Silver SARIMA chart](/images/7.2_AG_ARIMA.png)
*Line chart of the historical price of silver since 2022, including a 6-month forecast and its confidence interval.*

**Silver prices are expected to rise steadily over the next six months, much like gold. Although the model parameters are the same to those used for gold, the confidence interval for silver is significantly wider.**

### Conclusions
- Gold YoY real returns are much higher than anticipated.
- Although silver YoY returns initially appeared higher than gold's, deeper analysis shows gold as the best-performing metal.
- Both metals are highly correlated, as expected, with silver being twice as volatile.
- ARIMA models use historical data to forecast future events, assuming past values impact future values. However, past performance is not a guaranteed indicator of future results, and these models cannot predict unpredictable events like market crashes or natural disasters.
- Gold is not a perfect inflation hedge, as shown by its correlation with the CPI. The metal's real historical value has significant valleys, as well as notable volatility. However, if held for at least 30 years, gold can indeed serve as an inflation hedge or even provide real returns. This is not the case for silver, which is much less likely to be an inflation hedge.
- According to the Lindy effect, gold (and to a lesser degree, silver) will continue to be what they have always been: safe havens.
